# Rocketry PI&D KiCAD Library

This repository contains a set of P&ID symbols as KiCAD symbols. The symbol set was created for use in rocketry by UK university rocketry teams:

- Kingston University London (KURE)
- Sheffield University (Sunride)
- Glasgow University (GU Rocketry)

We put together this symbol set to standardise our P&ID diagrams for easier collaborations and coherence. 

## Symbols

There is one .kicad_sym file per symbol which is contained in the symbols folder. To use, add the relevant .kicad_sym files to your project library.

Alternatively you can download the rocketry_pid.kicad_sym file which includes all symbols (automatically keep up-to-date)


## Collaborations

We are open to contribution to the symbol set. Please adhere to the format provided. Symbols fit in a 10mm x 10mm footprint, with leads fitting into a concentric 15mm x 15mm footprint. Note for larger items, the concentric footprints increase as follows 20mm x 20mm, 50mm x 50mm.

A template file is provided

## In progress

- Script to plot (finish)
- Script to generate README with images for quick viewing (better)
- Footprint rules to ensure standardisation (implement)
- Precommits so individual symbols and the library are up to date (implement)
- CI/CD (implement)
- Addition of templates (add)
